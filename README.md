# Lung-Cancer-Detection-using-Deep-Learning
This repository contains the code for a deep learning project aimed at detecting lung cancer from CT scan images. The project utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and pre-trained models to classify lung CT scan images into different cancer types, including squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, large cell carcinoma, and normal lung tissue.
Features:-
Utilizes popular pre-trained CNN models such as VGG16, InceptionV3, and EfficientNetB0.
Implements data augmentation and preprocessing techniques to enhance model robustness.
Includes training, validation, and testing scripts for model evaluation.
Provides options for fine-tuning hyperparameters and exploring regularization techniques.
Offers future research directions for advancing lung cancer detection using deep learning.
